# MISTAKES in the ORIGINAL CODE
* the picture in this folder says at the 90th block 1 is shown but there are two blocks surrounding it

# PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED THAT ARE NOT IN CODE #

 1. align items property not working
   


# THINGS I LEARNED #
 
 1. array making

 3. dynamic nature of js and i can fit any type of element in the array
 4. event listener use e when document property or methods needs to be called other for custom method call as is
 5. standard bfs is not possible coz of edges
